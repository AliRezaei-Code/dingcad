# 🔒 Security Stuff

Right now only the `master` branch might likely get security attention. (use at your own risk)  
If you’re using an older tag or fork, pull the latest `master` or you're cooked.   

If you spot something sketchy, DM [@yacineMTB](https://x.com/yacineMTB) on X or open an issue here or just be a homie and submit a PR with a fix.  

Once it’s fixed, we’ll push the update or merge it.  

That’s it. Have fun and don't get hacked!
